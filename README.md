# Kaftoko - A Viossa Wordle Game

**üëã Braa Tula Kaftoko Hanu Made! üëã**

This is a Wordle-like game designed for the Viossa community conlang.

## What is Viossa?

Viossa (IPA: /vi.Àào ä.sa/, /vi.Àà…í.sa/) is an experimental, community-created, artificial pidgin language. It was created in 2014 by members of the r/conlangs community on Reddit to simulate how a pidgin language might form. One of its core principles is: "if one is understood, they are using the language correctly." This means there are no fixed standards for grammar, orthography, semantics, or phonetics.

The language is characterized by its lack of standardization, with each speaker developing a personal idiolect. Spelling, in particular, can vary greatly and is often a form of self-expression.

‚û°Ô∏è Learn more about Viossa on its [Wikipedia page](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viossa>).

## A Note On Spelling

A core part of Viossa's charm (and challenge!) is its flexible orthography. The same word can have multiple accepted spellings. For example, a common word in Viossa might be spelled *jaa*, *ya*, or *i√°*, and all are valid.

In Kaftoko, we embrace this! While a word like *kyomi* might be validly spelled *kiomi*, *kjomi*, or *kyomi* in general Viossa use, for the purpose of this game, **only one specific spelling will be the target word each day.**

Part of the fun is using your knowledge of common Viossa patterns and context clues to determine the specific spelling variant used for the daily word. Don't be discouraged if a spelling you know isn't the answer! There's actually more information density per word in Kaftoko compared to English wordle, so you should have on average as many guesses used.


### Keyboard & Character Limitations

Please note the following about the in-game keyboard and word selection:
*   **No Diacritics:** The in-game keyboard does **not** include diacritics (e.g., √°, √©, ≈õ).
*   **No 'X' or 'Q':** The letters 'X' and 'Q' have been removed from the keyboard as they are not typically used in common Viossa.
*   **Implicit Diacritics:** Because of the no-diacritics rule, some words that might traditionally use them will appear in their simplified form. For example, a word like *shiknu* or *≈õiknu* will be represented as **siknu** in the game. The diacritic is considered implicit.

### üé® GUI Language üé®
Kaftoko allows you to change how the game's interface is displayed! You can experience the game through:
*   **Different community kakutro:** See the game text in familiar (or unfamiliar lol) spelling variants like those used by Wynter or Paneku :D
*   **Entirely different scripts:** Play with the GUI rendered in scripts such as Hangul (ÌïúÍ∏Ä), Katakana („Ç´„Çø„Ç´„Éä), Cyrillic (–ö–∏—Ä–∏–ª–ª–∏—Ü–∞), and more!

**Important Note:** These GUI options only change the visual presentation of the game's interface. The daily target word will still be in the standard Latin-script `kakutro` as chosen for that day, and your input will still follow the keyboard limitations outlined below.


## The Word List

The current word list for Kaftoko was compiled with a mix of methods:
*   A significant portion comes from statistical analysis of Viossa usage, focusing on approximately the 300 most common 5-letter words.
*   Some words were hand-picked because they are _goofy_, largely agreed upon in spelling despite their rarity, or represent interesting, but common variations.
*  In some cases, a specific spelling was chosen over another based on perceived commonality or aesthetic preference (e.g., *fasto* was not included despite being a relatively common variant of *fshto*, it felt like it just didn't come to mind! I didn't like it!).
*   There's like a 1/300 chance of getting a troll word. :middle_finger_emoji:

The list aims to be representative of common 5-letter Viossa words while also being fun and playable. You should even be able to learn a few words you didn't know prior by triangulating them :D. Once again, do keep in mind _you can use any spelling you wish_, it's just that the daily word will be in a more common spelling variant.

## Contributing & Word Suggestions

Viossa is a living, evolving language, and Kaftoko can evolve with it!
If you have a 5-letter Viossa word (or a specific spelling of a word) that you think would be a great addition to the game, please feel free to suggest it! I try to include words that are considered broadly representative of our community, so I may bias away from spellings or words that are too ideosyncratic.
